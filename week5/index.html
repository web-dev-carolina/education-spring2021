      <a name="experiences"></a>  
      <p id="about-paragraph"> Ever since I was a young boy, I had a passion for problem solving. I first learned Java when I was five 
          years old (I learned it while I was learning English) and I have learned 18 other programming languages since then.
          I consider myself to be very humble but also one of the best programmers and web developers in the country. My favorite
          activities include coding, programming, making websites, learning how to code, learning how to code websites, and taking
          long walks on the beach. I hope you enjoy my website!

      <div class="experience">
        <h5>WebDev Carolina Member</h5>
        <h6>10 years</h6>
        <p>As a member of WebDev Carolina, I have created 800 websites on my own for multiple small business, medium business,
            and large business (such as Google) around the world. I work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Git, and VSCode. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Here</a>
            is a link to the best website I have created.

          <h5>Google Frontend Software Developer</h5>
          <h6>15 years</h6>
          <p>As a frontend software developer at Google, I created the entire website and every website that uses something created by
              Google. For example, if you see a website which uses Google ads or which allows you to log in through Google, I am responsible
              for creating it. I am also responsible for leading a team of hundreds of thousands of other employees who are all of lesser
              skill than me so that they can also create websites. I work with JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS in this job.

          <h5>Student at UNC Chapel Hill</h5>
          <h6>3 years</h6>
          <p>At UNC Chapel Hill, I major in Computer Science and constantly compare myself to other students to make them feel
              worse about themselves (I do this out of love for my school). I also played on the basketball team for a few years
              but they kicked me off because I was too good and they also wanted me to further pursue Computer Science. After
              graudation, it is rumored that Sitterson will be renamed after me. Relevant courses I have taken include COMP 401: Foundations
              of Programming, COMP 410: Data Structures, and COMP 426: Modern Web Development.

              I don't have any hobbies, but if I did I'd write about them here and include a cool photo. All I do is code and program and make websites
              so I decided to include a photo of that. This is definitely the same man you saw in the photo above
